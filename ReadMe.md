---------------------------------------- idea ----------------------------------------
My idea is to create a website that sells cosmetics and beauty products (similar to SEPHORA) but with my own color pallete and designs
My color pallete consists of mainly pink and pastel colors like beige as it is aesthetically pleasing.
I have chosen to design my website this way as it is easy for users to navigate around my website.
